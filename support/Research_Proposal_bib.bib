  abstract = {Quantifying ground-ice volume on a regional scale is necessary to assess the vulnerability of permafrost landscapes to thaw-induced disturbance like terrain subsidence and to quantify potential carbon release. Ice wedges (IWs) are a ubiquitous ground-ice landform in the Arctic. Their high spatial variability makes generalizing their potential role in landscape change problematic. IWs form polygonal networks that are visible on satellite imagery from surface troughs. This study provides a first approximation of IW ice volume for the Fosheim Peninsula, Ellesmere Island, a continuous permafrost area characterized by polar desert conditions and extensive ground ice. We perform basic GIS analyses on high-resolution satellite imagery to delineate IW troughs and estimate the associated IW ice volume using a 3-D subsurface model. We demonstrate the potential of two semi-automated IW trough delineation methods, one newly developed and one marginally used in previous studies, to increase the time efficiency of this process compared to manual delineation. Our methods yield acceptable IW ice volume estimates, validating the value of GIS to estimate IW volume on much larger scales. We estimate that IWs are potentially present on 50 \% of the Fosheim Peninsula ( ∼ 3000 km2), where 3.81 \% of the top 5.9 m of permafrost could be IW ice.},

The rate of permafrost thaw is controlled by surface and subsurface properties and processes, all of which are potentially linked with each other. However, no standardized protocol exists for measuring permafrost thaw and related processes and properties in a linked manner. The permafrost thaw action group of the Terrestrial Multidisciplinary distributed Observatories for the Study of the Arctic Connections (T-MOSAiC) project has developed a protocol, for use by non-specialist scientists and technicians, citizen scientists, and indigenous groups, to collect standardized metadata and data on permafrost thaw. The protocol introduced here addresses the need to jointly measure permafrost thaw and the associated surface and subsurface environmental conditions. The parameters measured along transects include: snow depth, thaw depth, vegetation height, soil texture, and water level. The metadata collection includes data on timing of data collection, geographical coordinates, land surface characteristics (vegetation, ground surface, water conditions), as well as photographs. Our hope is that this openly available dataset will also be highly valuable for validation and parameterization of numerical and conceptual models, and thus to the broad community represented by the T-MOSAiC project.},

  abstract = {Layers of permafrost developed during the 1950s and 1960s incorporated tritium from the atmosphere that originated from global nuclear weapons testing. In regions underlain by substantial permafrost, this tritium has been effectively trapped in ice since it was deposited and subject to radioactive decay alone, which has substantially lengthened its environmental half-life compared to areas with little or no permafrost where the weapons-test era precipitation has been subject to both decay and hydrodynamic dispersion. The Arctic is warming three times faster than other parts of the world, with northern regions incurring some of the most pronounced effects of climate change, resulting in permafrost degradation. A series of 23 waterbodies across the Canadian sub-Arctic spanning the continuous, discontinuous and isolated patches permafrost zones in northern Manitoba, Northwest Territories and Labrador were sampled. Surface water and groundwater seepage samples were collected from each lake and analyzed for tritium, stable isotopes (δ18O and δ2H) and general water chemistry characteristics. Measured tritium was significantly higher in surface waters (SW) and groundwater seepage (GW) in water bodies located in the sporadic discontinuous (64 ± 15 T U. in SW and 52 ± 9 T U. in GW) and extensive discontinuous (53 ± 7 T U. in SW and 61 ± 7 T U. in GW) permafrost regions of the Northwest Territories than in regions underlain by continuous permafrost in northern Manitoba ({$<$} 12 T U. in both SW and GW) or those within isolated patches of permafrost in Labrador (16 ± 2 T U. in SW and 21 ± 4 T U. in GW). The greatest tritium enrichment (up to 128 T U.) was observed in lakes near Jean Marie River in the Mackenzie River valley, a region known to be experiencing extensive permafrost degradation. These results demonstrate significant permafrost degradation in the central Mackenzie River basin and show that tritium is becoming increasingly mobile in the sub-Arctic environment—at concentrations higher than expected—as a result of a warming climate. A better understanding of the cycling of tritium in the environment will improve our understanding of Arctic radioecology under changing environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {The Mackenzie Delta, prograding northwestwards into the Beaufort Sea, is North America’s largest arctic delta. This Holocene feature is bounded by rolling uplands to the east and the Richardson Mountains to the west. Treeline traverses the region, separating the subarctic boreal forest in southern parts from low-shrub tundra and sedge wetlands at the coast. The region is experiencing rapid climate change, and mean annual air temperature has increased by more than 2.58C since 1970. The area was at the margin of the Wisconsinan ice sheet, so that in the uplands the mean annual ground temperature and glacial history control permafrost thickness, which varies from {$>$}700 m to {$<$}100 m. Ground temperatures in the delta are distinct from the uplands due to the thermal influence of numerous lakes and shifting channels. In the uplands, ground temperatures decrease northwards across treeline in association with a decrease in the thickness of snow cover. Ground temperatures have increased since 1970 in the uplands by approximately 1.58C in association with rising annual mean air temperature. The increase has been less in the delta south of treeline due to the extensive thermal influence of water bodies on ground temperature. However, in the outer delta, the ground is currently more than 2.58C warmer than in 1970. The impact of climate change on permafrost is also evident in the thickness of the active layer, which increased on average by 8 cm at 12 tundra sites on northern Richards Island from 1983–2008.

  abstract = {The summer of 2021 in the Inuvik area, NWT was warm and dry. As recorded in Siksik Creek, a sub-catchment of Trail Valley Creek located 50 km north-east of Inuvik, this was the 7th warmest summer and driest July recorded to date. This presented a unique opportunity to study the drying phenomena of Arctic ecosystems. This is pertinent to the study of permafrost degradation, as the drying phenomena is still vastly understudied and there are few datasets available that record abnormally dry conditions in Arctic catchments. These data sets are needed to properly show the influence that this has on active layer thicknesses. It is unknown whether these conditions may pose a risk to permafrost, if this is spatially variable, and what other processes might amplify or hinder this. The main objective of this thesis is to explore how a dry year affects active layer thaw and the hydrology of Siksik Creek so that we may better understand how catchments such as Siksik will respond to ongoing climate change. To do this a mix of field results and modelling was used to show and quantify how these may affect active layer thaw as well as water balance components. The three main research chapters of this thesis divide this by analyzing active layer thaw as physically measured in the catchment to previous years, by using the model GEOtop to assess how this affects water balance components, and then by simulating wetter conditions to show the affect soil moisture has.},

  abstract = {Upland permafrost regions occupy approximately one third of the Arctic landscape. In upland regions, hydrologic fluxes are influenced by water tracks, curvilinear features on hillslopes that preferentially fill with and route water in response to snowmelt and rainfall when the soil above continuous permafrost thaws in the summer. As continued warming of the Arctic may alter hydrologic cycling leading to increased frequency of extreme hydrologic events like drought and flooding as well as modification of biogeochemical cycling, it is imperative to untangle the interplay between precipitation, runoff, and subsurface flow as water is routed from upland Arctic regions to the Arctic Ocean. This study quantifies how ground surface temperatures affect groundwater discharge from hillslopes with water tracks in the upland Arctic by employing a three‐dimensional, physically based subsurface flow model with variable saturation and freeze and thaw capabilities that is calibrated to field measurements from the Upper Kuparuk River watershed on the North Slope of Alaska, USA. Model analysis indicates that higher ground surface temperatures along water track hillslopes promote increases in groundwater discharge where water tracks act as conduits for large‐recharge events and continue to discharge groundwater into the autumn after the adjacent hillslope has frozen. Simulating the conditions that distinguish water tracks from their hillslope watersheds changes subsurface water storage and ground thermal responses but does not alter the total magnitude of groundwater discharge outside of parameter uncertainty. These findings suggest that water tracks play a complex and critical role in hydrologic cycles of the upland Arctic. Plain Language Summary The flow of liquid water in the Arctic is largely constrained to the ground surface and shallow subsurface above perennially frozen ground known as permafrost. As the Arctic climate warms, permafrost will thaw more deeply, altering the paths along which water is transported from mountains to downstream areas that discharge water into the ocean. One of the primary paths that water flows in the Arctic is along water tracks, curvilinear features on hillslopes that fill with and route water in response to snowmelt and rainfall when the soil above permafrost thaws in the summer. Although hillslopes with water tracks cover as much as one third of the Arctic landscape, little is known about the magnitude and seasonality of flow through water tracks. In this study, we create a three‐dimensional subsurface model of an Arctic hillslope with a water track that incorporates field measurements from the North Slope of Alaska, USA. Results indicate that subsurface water flows preferentially from adjacent hillslopes into water tracks, especially after large rainstorms and in the autumn when the adjacent hillslopes start to freeze. These results suggest that water tracks may play an important, but complex, role in predicting water budget responses to changing Arctic landscapes.},

The late Holocene sedimentation led to an increase in the thermal contraction coefficient of the soil and the formation of third- and fourth-order contraction cracks, partially explaining the current configuration of the polygonal network. The upturning of the sedimentary strata bordering the ice wedges was associated with the summer thermal expansion and resulting internal creep of the soil. The mean annual soil displacement coefficient was in the order of 2.5–2.7 × 10–5 /°C at the thousand-year scale. The late Holocene sedimentary strata under the centre of the polygons were undisturbed, which will make it possible to use this sedimentary record in further studies to attempt paleoenvironmental reconstructions from cores.},

Water samples from lakes included a group of 14 thaw lakes that had higher runoff attributed to melting of permafrost in peat plateaus within their watersheds. While tritium in all lakes was found to be intermediate between recent and 1960s concentrations, the thaw lakes were found to be significantly enriched in tritium compared with other lakes, as were unfrozen wetlands characterized by a thick sequence of low-hydraulic conductivity peat. The results provide further evidence of different water sources to the thaw lakes and may indicate that melting of modern permafrost in part formed since the 1950s is occurring in these systems.

It is essential guaranteed to improve data processing accurately and effectively. In this paper, we employ predictive deconvolution methods to remove multiples to enhance signal noise ratio. Permafrost physical properties were studied, so that permafrost recognition algorithm would be given to detect frozen disease. Firstly, we test this algorithm at Central South University by GR-III GPR, where the results were shown an effective and efficient GPR equipment and permafrost recognition algorithm chosen. According to simulation of the geological data of the typical testing section of Qinghai-Tibet railway, predictive deconvolution method could remove most of multiples from synthetic data. At the end, we explored the permafrost on Qumar area on the Qinghai-Tibet highland. A high quality interpretation was given after the data processing.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Roads constructed on permafrost can have a significant impact on the surrounding environment, potentially inducing permafrost degradation. These impacts arise from factors such as snow accumulation near the road, which affects the soil's thermal and hydrological regime, and road dust that decreases the snow's albedo, altering the timing of snowmelt. However, our current understanding of the magnitude and the spatial extent of these effects is limited. In this study we addressed this gap by using remote sensing techniques to assess the spatial effect of the Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk Highway (ITH) in Northwest Territories, Canada, on snow accumulation, snow albedo and snowmelt patterns. With a new, high resolution snow depth raster from airborne laser scanning, we quantified the snow accumulation at road segments in the Trail Valley Creek area using digital elevation model differencing. We found increased snow accumulation up to 36\,m from the road center. The magnitude of this snow accumulation was influenced by the prevailing wind direction and the embankment height. Furthermore, by analyzing 43 Sentinel-2 satellite images between February and May~2020, we observed reduced snow albedo values within 500\,m of the road, resulting in a 12-days-earlier onset of snowmelt within 100\,m from the road. We examined snowmelt patterns before, during and after the road construction using the normalized difference snow index from Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 imagery. Our analysis revealed that the road affected the snowmelt pattern up to 600\,m from the road, even in areas which appeared undisturbed. In summary, our study improves our understanding of the spatial impact of gravel roads on permafrost due to enhanced snow accumulation, reduced snow albedo and earlier snowmelt. Our study underscores the important contribution that remote sensing can provide to improve our understanding of the effects of infrastructure development on permafrost environments.},

  abstract = {Massive ground ice in Arctic regions underlain using continuous permafrost influences hydrologic processes, leading to ground subsidence and the release of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. The relation of massive ground ice such as ice wedges to water tracks and seasonally saturated hydrologic pathways remains uncertain. Here, we examine the location of ice wedges along a water track on the North Slope of Alaska using Ground‐Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys, in situ measurements, soil cores, and forward modeling. Of nine unique GPR surveys collected in the summers of 2022 and 2023, seven exhibit distinctive “X”‐shaped reflections above columnar reflectors that are spatially correlated with water track margins. Forward modeling of plausible geometries suggests that ice wedges produce reflection patterns most similar to the reflections observed in our GPR profiles. Additionally, a large magnitude (∼71 mm) rain event on 8 July 2023 led to a ground collapse that exposed four ice wedges on the margin of the studied water track, ∼100 m downstream of our GPR surveys. Together, this suggests that GPR is a viable method for identifying the location of ice wedges as air temperatures in the Arctic continue to increase, we expect that ice wedges may thaw, destabilizing water tracks and causing ground collapse and expansion of thermo‐erosional gullies. This ground collapse will increase greenhouse gas emissions and threaten the Arctic infrastructure. Future geophysical analysis of upland Arctic hillslopes should include additional water tracks to better characterize potential heterogeneity in permafrost vulnerability across the warming Arctic.},

  abstract = {Arctic permafrost is facing significant changes due to global climate change. As these regions are largely inaccessible, remote sensing plays a crucial rule in better understanding the underlying processes across the Arctic. In this study, we focus on the remote detection of retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs), a permafrost disturbance comparable to slow landslides. For such remote sensing tasks, deep learning has become an indispensable tool, but limited labeled training data remains a challenge for training accurate models. We present PixelDINO, a semisupervised learning approach, to improve model generalization across the Arctic with a limited number of labels. PixelDINO leverages unlabeled data by training the model to define its own segmentation categories (pseudoclasses), promoting consistent structural learning across strong data augmentations. This allows the model to extract structural information from unlabeled data, supplementing the learning from labeled data. PixelDINO surpasses both supervised baselines and existing semisupervised methods, achieving average intersection-over-union (IoU) of 30.2 and 39.5 on the two evaluation sets, representing significant improvements of 13\% and 21\%, respectively, over the strongest existing models. This highlights the potential for training robust models that generalize well to regions that were not included in the training data.},

  abstract = {A ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey was conducted in May 1999 on the 1 km2 Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) grid 5 km east of Barrow, Alaska. Spatially continuous measurements were collected along established transects while the active layer remained frozen. The primary objectives were to determine the ‘long-term’ position of the permafrost table, to recognize ice wedges and ice lenses, and to locate the organic–mineral soil interface. GPR signal and core collection were performed in tandem to verify signal interpretation, to calibrate the instrument, and to determine optimal GPR data-collection parameters. Two-way travel times from the antenna to subsurface reflectors were compared with measured depths obtained from soil cores to estimate an average pulse propagation velocity of 0.13 m/ns through the frozen soil. The most conspicuous subsurface reflectors were ice wedges, which gave high-amplitude hyperbolic reflections. Owing to its higher ice content, the approximate long-term position of the permafrost table could be traced laterally across the profile. Radar interpretations were obscured by the effects of cryoturbation, and because some horizons lack sufficient contrast in electrical properties. Highly detailed information can be obtained by collecting radar data at relatively slow speeds of advance, by using faster scanning rates ({$>$}32 scans/s), and by employing high-frequency antennas ({$>$}400 MHz).

  abstract = {Abstract             Changes in the frequency and extent of wildfires are expected to lead to substantial and irreversible alterations to permafrost landscapes under a warming climate. Here we review recent publications (2010–2019) that advance our understanding of the effects of wildfire on surface and ground temperatures, on active layer thickness and, where permafrost is ice‐rich, on ground subsidence and the development of thermokarst features. These thermal and geomorphic changes are initiated immediately following wildfire and alter the hydrology and biogeochemistry of permafrost landscapes, including the release of previously frozen carbon. In many locations, permafrost has been resilient, with key characteristics such as active layer thickness returning to pre‐fire conditions after several decades. However, permafrost near its southern limit is losing this resiliency as a result of ongoing climate warming and increasingly common vegetation state changes. Shifts in fire return intervals, severity and extent are expected to alter the trajectories of wildfire impacts on permafrost, and to enlarge spatial impacts to more regularly include the burning of tundra areas. Modeling indicates some lowland boreal forest and tundra environments will remain resilient while uplands and areas with thin organic layers and dry soils will experience rapid and irreversible permafrost degradation. More work is needed to relate modeling to empirical studies, particularly incorporating dynamic variables such as soil moisture, snow and thermokarst development, and to identify post‐fire permafrost responses for different landscape types and regions. Future progress requires further collaboration among geocryologists, ecologists, hydrologists, biogeochemists, modelers and remote sensing specialists.},

This work presents an overview on sources of anthropogenic radionuclides in the environment, as well as a brief discussion of salient geochemical behavior of important radionuclides. We first discuss the following major anthropogenic sources and current developments that have lead, or could potentially contribute, to the radionuclide contamination of the environment: (1) nuclear weapons program; (2) nuclear weapons testing; (3) nuclear power plants; (4) uranium mining and milling; (5) commercial fuel reprocessing; (6) geological repository of high-level nuclear wastes that include radionuclides might be released in the future, and (7) nuclear accidents. Then, we briefly summarize the inventory of radionuclides 99Tc and 129I, as well as geochemical behavior for radionuclides 99Tc, 129I, and 237Np, because of their complex geochemical behavior, long half-lives, and presumably high mobility in the environment; biogeochemical cycling and environment risk assessment must take into account speciation of these redox-sensitive radionuclides.

Throughout circumpolar regions, permafrost has preserved relict ground ice and glacigenic sediments, delaying the sequence of postglacial landscape change that transformed temperate environments millennia earlier. Here we show that within 7 × 106 km2 of glaciated permafrost terrain, extensive landscapes remain poised for major climate-driven change. Across northwestern Canada, 60–100-km-wide concentric swaths of thaw slump–affected terrain delineate the maximum and recessional positions of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.

These thaw slump, relict ground ice, and glacigenic terrain associations are also evident at the circumpolar scale. Recent intensification of thaw slumping across northwestern Canada has mobilized primary glacial sediments, triggering a cascade of fluvial, lacustrine, and coastal effects. These geologically significant processes, highlighted by the spatial distribution of thaw slumps and patterns of fluvial sediment mobilization, signal the climate-driven renewal of deglaciation and postglacial permafrost landscape evolution.},

The diameters of collapsed earth hummocks were significantly greater than those of well-developed vegetated hummocks. Hummock relief and interhummock distance increased along the continuum of forms, with the widest spacing and greatest relief measured at the site with well-developed vegetated hummocks. A bowl-shaped permafrost table mirrored the surface relief of most hummocks, but the collapsed hummocks were underlain by a planar or domed permafrost table. Segregated ice lenses parallel to the permafrost table, and small bodies of intrusive ice, were observed beneath the developing and well-developed hummocks. The configuration of the permafrost table and hummock relief, long-term observations of active-layer and hummock change, and hummock response to surface manipulation indicate that formation of a bowl-shaped permafrost table in association with organic accumulation and development of near-surface ground ice thrusts soils inward and upward causing hummock growth, whereas thaw subsidence may cause outward spreading and hummock collapse. Reaction-wood rings in black spruce trees growing on hummocky terrain indicate that tree tilting was associated with active-layer thinning and hummock growth. Cessation of reaction wood coincided with a period of active-layer deepening, degradation of ground ice, and outward spreading of the hummocks. In subarctic forests, hummock dynamics may be driven by ecological change associated with the fire cycle or climate change.},

  abstract = {Hummocks (nonsorted circles) are widely distributed in arctic and subarctic regions. The hummocks under discussion are composed of fine-grained frost-susceptible soils; the late summer frost table is bowl-shaped; and the hummocks grade from those which are completely vegetated (earth hummocks) to those with bare centres (mud hummocks). The mound form is usually attributed to an upward displacement of material resulting from cryostatic (freeze-back) pressure generated in a confined, wet, unfrozen pocket of the active layer. Theoretically, cryostatic pressure should not develop in a frost-susceptible hummock soil, because ice lensing at the top and (or) bottom of the active layer will desiccate the last unfrozen pocket so that the pore water is under tension, not pressure. Field observations carried out at Garry Island, Northwest Territories, for 1965–1979 and for 1967–1979 at Inuvik, Northwest Territories, involving: summer and winter excavations; the measurement of the deformation of tubes, soil pressure, soil temperature, soil heave, soil moisture migration; and observations on hummock stability provide no field evidence for the cryostatic theory. An alternative model of hummock growth, based upon field observations, is here proposed. The upward displacement of material is believed caused by freeze–thaw of ice lenses at the top and bottom of the active layer with a gravity-induced cell-like movement, because the top and bottom freeze–thaw zones have opposite curvatures. The cell circulation is evident from the grain-size distribution of hummock soils and from upward-moving tongues of saturated soil observable in late summer. The most active period is in late summer. Model experiments in the laboratory have been successful in producing mounds by freeze–thaw of a kaolin slurry in a bowl-shaped container in support of the proposed theory.},

  abstract = {Spatial variation in lake sedimentation within the Mackenzie Delta was documented, and total lake sedimentation over the past 30 years was estimated, by classifying (via aerial photography) the Øooding characteristics of a complete transect of lakes (about 2600 lakes) across the upper subaerial delta plain, then selecting representative samples of lakes (81 lakes) from the transect, and a random sample of lakes from a second transect (7 lakes) across the lower subaerial plain, for direct measurement of sedimentation rates. The depth corresponding to the 1963 sediment layer was obtained from a sediment core from each of these lakes by sampling the core at frequent depth intervals to identify the peak in 137Cs (Caesium-137) content. Lake sediment bulk densities, as obtained from the cores, averaged 931 kg/m3, a value lower than reported in previous studies. Using mean bulk density above each 137Cs peak, and the depth of the 137Cs peak, mean lake sedimentation for dierent lake types varied between 1.19 kg/m2/yr and 5.34 kg/m2/yr, with a decrease in sedimentation as lake sill elevation increased. Values for the lower delta transect averaged 1.36 kg/m2/yr. By combining relationships between sedimentation and lake type with a classiÆcation of lake types, total sedimentation across the upper-delta transect is estimated as 8.2 Mt/yr, and 0.8 Mt/yr for the lower delta. These values are lower than previously reported primarily because they are derived from lower bulk density values. Of the total upper-delta sedimentation, 17\% occurs in high-closure lakes, 53\% in low-closure lakes, and 30\% in no-closure lakes. Lake sedimentation is higher in the Middle Channel segment of the upper-delta transect (44\% of total sedimentation across the transect) than in the East Channel (25\%) or Peel Channel (32\%) segments.

  abstract = {Abstract. Ice-wedge polygons are common features of lowland tundra in the continuous permafrost zone and prone to rapid degradation through melting of ground ice. There are many interrelated processes involved in ice-wedge thermokarst and it is a major challenge to quantify their influence on the stability of the permafrost underlying the landscape. In this study we used a numerical modelling approach to investigate the degradation of ice wedges with a focus on the influence of hydrological conditions. Our study area was Samoylov Island in the Lena River delta of northern Siberia, for which we had in situ measurements to evaluate the model. The tailored version of the CryoGrid~3 land surface model was capable of simulating the changing microtopography of polygonal tundra and also regarded lateral fluxes of heat, water, and snow. We demonstrated that the approach is capable of simulating ice-wedge degradation and the associated transition from a low-centred to a high-centred polygonal microtopography. The model simulations showed ice-wedge degradation under recent climatic conditions of the study area, irrespective of hydrological conditions. However, we found that wetter conditions lead to an earlier onset of degradation and cause more rapid ground subsidence. We set our findings in correspondence to observed types of ice-wedge polygons in the study area and hypothesized on remaining discrepancies between modelled and observed ice-wedge thermokarst activity. Our quantitative approach provides a valuable complement to previous, more qualitative and conceptual, descriptions of the possible pathways of ice-wedge polygon evolution. We concluded that our study is a blueprint for investigating thermokarst landforms and marks a step forward in understanding the complex interrelationships between various processes shaping ice-rich permafrost landscapes.},

  abstract = {The external drivers and internal controls of groundwater flow in the thawed “active layer” above permafrost are poorly constrained because they are dynamic and spatially variable. Understanding these controls is critical because groundwater can supply solutes such as dissolved organic matter to surface water bodies. We calculated steady‐state three‐dimensional suprapermafrost groundwater flow through the active layer using measurements of aquifer geometry, saturated thickness, and hydraulic properties collected from two major landscape types over time within a first‐order Arctic watershed. The depth position and thickness of the saturated zone is the dominant control of groundwater flow variability between sites and during different times of year. The effect of water table depth on groundwater flow dwarfs the effect of thaw depth. In landscapes with low land‐surface slopes (2–4\%), a combination of higher water tables and thicker, permeable peat deposits cause relatively constant groundwater flows between the early and late thawed seasons. Landscapes with larger land‐surface slopes (4–10\%) have both deeper water tables and thinner peat deposits; here the commonly observed permeability decrease with depth is more pronounced than in flatter areas, and groundwater flows decrease significantly between early and late summer as the water table drops. Groundwater flows are also affected by microtopographic features that retain groundwater that could otherwise be released as the active layer deepens. The dominant sources of groundwater, and thus dissolved organic matter, are likely wet, flatter regions with thick organic layers. This finding informs fluid flow and solute transport dynamics for the present and future Arctic. Plain Language Summary Groundwater flow in permafrost watersheds is potentially a key component of global carbon budgets because permafrost soil stores vast amounts of carbon that could be mobilized due to a warming climate and the corresponding increase in soil thaw. In addition to carrying carbon, groundwater can supply important nutrients and solutes to surface waters. However, we do not yet understand the factors that control groundwater flow in soils above permafrost because saturation changes rapidly and continuously, and soil hydraulic properties are largely unknown. We created measurement‐informed calculations of groundwater flow from areas of permafrost with different characteristics and found that soil types, which vary based on the slope of the land surface, are the most important control. Near‐surface soils were identical in hillslopes and valleys, whereas deeper soils in hillslopes allowed for less groundwater flow than in valleys. In early summer, when only the near‐surface soils were thawed, groundwater flows in the hillslopes and valley were similar. In late summer, when the deeper soil was thawed, groundwater flow in the valley remained high, but flow in the hillslope was negligible. Our observations also showed that small mounds on the land surface caused groundwater to be trapped behind underground ice dams.},

That most variables of the collection project onto a single pattern of change suggests that the Arctic is responding as a coherent system over the previous three decades. However, no single index exclusively tracks change in the Arctic, a conclusion that emerges from a multivariate analysis.

We examined the physical and hydrological properties of water tracks on Ward Hunt Island, a polar desert site in the Canadian High Arctic, to evaluate their formation process and to compare with water tracks reported elsewhere. These High Arctic water tracks flowed through soils that possessed higher near-surface organic carbon concentrations, higher water content, and coarser material than the surrounding soils. The water track morphology suggested they were initiated by a combination of sorting, differential frost heaving, and eluviation. The resultant network of soil conduits, comparable to soil pipes, dominated the hydrology of the slope. The flow of cold water through these conduits slowed down the progression of the thawing front during summer, making the active layer consistently shallower relative to adjacent soils. Water tracks on Ward Hunt Island, and in polar desert catchments with these features elsewhere in the High Arctic, strongly influence slope hydrology and active-layer properties while also affecting vegetation distribution and the quality of runoff to the downstream lake.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of soils in the permafrost region has advanced immensely in recent decades, despite the remoteness and inaccessibility of most of the region and the sampling limitations posed by the severe environment. These efforts significantly increased estimates of the amount of organic carbon stored in permafrost-region soils and improved understanding of how pedogenic processes unique to permafrost environments built enormous organic carbon stocks during the Quaternary. This knowledge has also called attention to the importance of permafrost-affected soils to the global carbon cycle and the potential vulnerability of the region’s soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks to changing climatic conditions. In this review, we briefly introduce the permafrost characteristics, ice structures, and cryopedogenic processes that shape the development of permafrost-affected soils, and discuss their effects on soil structures and on organic matter distributions within the soil profile. We then examine the quantity of organic carbon stored in permafrost-region soils, as well as the characteristics, intrinsic decomposability, and potential vulnerability of this organic carbon to permafrost thaw under a warming climate. Overall, frozen conditions and cryopedogenic processes, such as cryoturbation, have slowed decomposition and enhanced the sequestration of organic carbon in permafrost-affected soils over millennial timescales. Due to the low temperatures, the organic matter in permafrost soils is often less humified than in more temperate soils, making some portion of this stored organic carbon relatively vulnerable to mineralization upon thawing of permafrost.},

  abstract = {In the Arctic tundra, subsurface drainage occurs predominantly through the saturated zone within the layer of peat that mantles the hillslopes. In plan view, the peat cover is fragmented into a network of channels due to the presence of mineral earth hummocks. In cross section, the physical and hydraulic properties of the peat vary with depth and the water transmission characteristics (e.g. hydraulic conductivity) of the upper profile differ distinctly from those of the lower. Water flow through the peat is laminar, therefore the friction factor ( f ) and the Reynolds number (NR) are inversely related. Average values for the coefficient C of the relation f à C=NR; vary from ,300 near the surface to ,14,500 at depth. This large difference in C confirms that the larger-diameter soil pores of the living vegetation and lightly decomposed peat near the surface offer much less resistance to water motion than the finer-grained peat deeper in the profile. Also, the variability suggests that subsurface drainage is strongly affected by the position and thickness of the saturated zone within the peat matrix. A first approximation for a model or simulation of the flow regime may consider a peat profile with depth-varying, resistance properties in respect to subsurface flow. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Abstract             Failing to account for barometric pressure effects in water level measurements can introduce errors by misestimating the total head and by adding noise to water level measurements. For determining the total head in an aquifer, we assert that the air pressure head at the water surface in the well must be added to measured water levels (equivalent to using an absolute pressure transducer) even though the resulting values may have larger temporal and spatial variability than the original water level measurements. At the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, the average barometric pressure variation is 6 to 7 cm, with a range of over 30 cm. Failure to account for barometric pressure variability could result in misestimation of the direction and magnitude of the hydraulic gradient at the site. We also demonstrate procedures for removing barometric effects, such as to reduce noise during an aquifer pumping test, and to identify mechanisms by which barometric pressure affects water levels. Three mechanisms are summarized including: an instantaneous response for confined aquifers; a delayed response due to borehole storage in confined and unconfined aquifers; and a delayed response in unconfined aquifers due to the passage of barometric pressure changes through the unsaturated zone. Using data from the Savannah River Site, barometric efficiencies are estimated using linear regression and a modification of Clark's Method. Delayed responses are estimated using regression deconvolution. The type of barometric effect provides diagnostic information about whether the aquifer is confined or not, the presence of borehole storage or skin effects, and the air diffusivity coefficient within the unsaturated zone. We also show how removal of barometric pressure effects improves the ability to observe otherwise unnoticeable effects.},

In this paper, the authors present an overview of tritium data sets of the Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG), the Helmholtz Zentrum München (HMGU) and the German Weather Service (DWD). Since the 1970s, all three institutions have monitored the tritium concentration at 53 surface water and 37 precipitation stations on a monthly basis. The primary purpose of the data set was to provide baseline information for different water types all over Germany as an integral part of the German radiation protection monitoring system. Additionally, as geochemically inert tracer, tritium provides a unique tool to different user groups in a wide range of research questions and applications.},

The MK test shows a general delay in the five timing measures of springtime streamflow, which are based on the 5 percentile (Q5), 10 percentile (Q10), 50 percentile (Q50), 90 percentile (Q90), and 95 percentile (Q95) dates of spring runoff, respectively. However, much stronger trend signals were clearly noted for the high percentiles than that for the low and middle percentiles, indicating different effects of hydroclimate processes working on the timing of springtime streamflow. In contrast, the earlier snowmelt onset derived from daily mean temperatures was found over the 27-year study period. In addition, multiple relationships were correlated between these five timing measures of spring runoff and five hydroclimate indicators (total snowfall, snowmelt onset, spring temperature fluctuation, spring rainfall, and spring rainfall timing) in order to identify possible causes on the changes of springtime streamflow timing. The results indicate that the differences are due to the contradictory effects of winter–spring air temperature changes, temperature fluctuation during the melting period, and spring rainfall to spring runoff. The earlier snowmelt onset, which is attributed to the winter–spring warming, and spring temperature fluctuation that works in the opposite way, result in the minor timing changes of Q5, Q10, and Q50. The increase in spring rainfall and its delayed timing have a significant impact on the dates of Q90 and Q95. Moreover, the decreased total snow accumulation over the winter season only has a minor influence on the timing of springtime streamflow.},

  abstract = {Ice wedges, which are ubiquitous in permafrost areas, play a significant role in the evolution of permafrost landscapes, influencing the topography and hydrology of these regions. In this paper, we combine a detailed multi-generational, interdisciplinary, and international literature review along with our own field experiences to explore the development of lowcentered ice-wedge polygons and their orthogonal networks. Low-centered polygons, a type of ice-wedge polygonal ground characterized by elevated rims and lowered wet central basins, are critical indicators of permafrost conditions. The formation of these features has been subject to numerous inconsistencies and debates since their initial description in the 1800s. The development of elevated rims is attributed to different processes, such as soil bulging due to ice-wedge growth, differential frost heave, and the accumulation of vegetation and peat. The transition of low-centered polygons to flat-centered, driven by processes like peat accumulation, aggradational ice formation, and frost heave in polygon centers, has been generally overlooked. Low-centered polygons occur in deltas, on floodplains, and in drained-lake basins. There, they are often arranged in orthogonal networks that comprise a complex system. The prevailing explanation of their formation does not match with several field studies that practically remain unnoticed or ignored. By analyzing controversial subjects, such as the degradational or aggradational nature of low-centered polygons and the formation of orthogonal ice-wedge networks, this paper aims to clarify misconceptions and present a cohesive overview of lowland terrain icewedge dynamics. The findings emphasize the critical role of ice wedges in shaping Arctic permafrost landscapes and their vulnerability to ongoing climatic and landscape changes.},

  abstract = {High-centred polygonal terrain is a widespread feature of Arctic landscapes that is sensitive to increasing ground temperatures because of its high ground-ice content. Understanding spatial variation in the distribution and sensitivity of high-centred polygonal terrain is important for predicting landscape change. In the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands, Northwest Territories, Canada, mean annual ground temperatures in permafrost have increased between 1 and 2°C over the last 40 years and high-centred polygonal terrain comprises about 10 per cent of the terrestrial landscape. To investigate factors affecting the distribution and potential degradation of ice wedges, we mapped high-centred polygonal terrain and ice-wedge melt ponds, and documented ice wedge related thermokarst at anthropogenic disturbances using 2004 aerial photographs. Historical melt pond distribution was assessed using 1972 aerial photographs. The density of polygonal terrain (up to 37\%) was significantly higher in the northern than the southern part of the study area, where more abundant lacustrine sediments and lower ground temperatures have favoured ice-wedge development. Larger proportional melt pond area (0.68\%), increases in pond area (up to 3.74\%) and a higher frequency of major thermokarst activity following anthropogenic surface disturbance (54\%) suggest that high-centred polygonal terrain in the northern part of the study area is more susceptible to degradation than in the southern part.

The combination of optimum offset and multifold GPR methods showed promising results in these investigations of sandy permafrost geological profiles. According to direct and indirect observations after the abnormally warm conditions in 2016, the thickness and water content of the active layer in 2017 almost returned to the values in 2015 in the Kashin area. In contrast, the lowering of the permafrost table continued at Kumzha, and lenses of thin frozen rocks that were observed in the thawed layer in August of 2015 and 2017 were absent in 2016. According to recent geocryological and geophysical observations, increasing permafrost degradation might be occurring in the Pechora River delta due to the instability of the thermal state of the permafrost.},

  abstract = {The warming trend in the Arctic region is expected to cause drastic changes including permafrost degradation and vegetation shifts. We investigated the spatial distribution of ice content and stable isotopic compositions of water in near-surface permafrost down to a depth of 1 m in the Indigirka River lowlands of northeastern Siberia to examine how the permafrost conditions control vegetation and microtopography in the Taiga–Tundra boundary ecosystem. The gravimetric water content (GWC) in the frozen soil layer was significantly higher at microtopographically high elevations with growing larch trees (i.e., tree mounds) than at low elevations with wetland vegetation (i.e., wet areas). The observed ground ice (ice-rich layer) with a high GWC in the tree mounds suggests that the relatively elevated microtopography of the land surface, which was formed by frost heave, strongly affects the survival of larch trees. The isotopic composition of the ground ice indicated that equilibrium isotopic fractionation occurred during ice segregation at the tree mounds, which implies that the ice formed with sufficient time for the migration of unfrozen soil water to the freezing front. In contrast, the isotopic data for the wet areas indicated that rapid freezing occurred under relatively non-equilibrium conditions, implying that there was insufficient time for ice segregation to occur. The freezing rate of the tree mounds was slower than that of the wet areas due to the difference of such as soil moisture and snow cover depends on vegetation and microtopography. These results indicate that future changes in snow cover, soil moisture, and organic layer, which control underground thermal conductivity, will have significant impacts on the freezing environment of the ground ice at the Taiga–Tundra boundary in northeastern Siberia. Such changes in the freezing environment will then affect vegetation due to changes in the microtopography of the ground surface.},

We define northern catchments as non-glacial sites in the temperate conifer/boreal/permafrost zone, focussing our review mainly on sites in North America and Europe. Improved empirical and theoretical understanding of hydrological functioning has advanced the analytical tools available for tracer-based hydrograph separations, derivation of transit time distributions and tracer-aided rainfall-runoff models that are better able to link hydrological response to storage changes. However, the lack of comprehensive tracer data sets still hinders development of a generalized understanding of how northern catchments will respond to change. This paucity of empirical data leads to many outstanding research needs, particularly in rapidly changing areas that are already responding to climatic warming and economic development. To continually improve our understanding of hydrological processes in these regions our knowledge needs to be advanced using a range of techniques and approaches. Recent technological developments for improved monitoring, distributed hydrological sensor systems, more economic analysis of large sample numbers in conjunction with novel, tracer-aided modelling approaches and the use of remote sensing have the potential to help the understanding of the northern hydrological systems as well as inform policy at a time of rapid environmental change.

Here, we present a method for calculating WIV in late Pleistocene Yedoma deposits and Holocene thermokarst basin deposits at four study areas in Siberia and Alaska. Ice-wedge polygons and thermokarst mound (baydzherakh) patterns were mapped on different landscape units using very high-resolution (0.5 m/pixel) satellite imagery (WorldView-1 and GeoEye-1). In a geographic information system (GIS) environment, Thiessen polygons were automatically created to reconstruct relict ice-wedge polygonal networks, and field and published data on ice-wedge dimensions were used to generate three-dimensional subsurface models that distinguish between epi- and syngenetic ice-wedge geometry. The results reveal significant variations in WIV between the study sites and within certain terrain units. Calculated maximum WIV ranges from 31.4 to 63.2 vol\% for Yedoma deposits and from 6.6 to 13.2 vol\% for thermokarst basin deposits. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Arctic shrub productivity trends display variability at multiple spatial scales. Fine‐scale studies have generally observed the greatest shrub expansion in landscape positions that accumulate water and nutrients. While considerable work has focused on the mediating effect of these resources on growth responses to warming, less is known about the mechanisms constraining recruitment‐driven expansion. Given the low seed viability of many Arctic shrubs, spatial patterns of seed dispersal may play an important role in constraining fine‐scale variability of shrub recruitment. This variability may also be driven by ground cover suitability, though these relationships are understudied in undisturbed sites. Here, we developed models representing seed accumulation mechanisms around Alnus alnobetula (green alder) patches within the taiga‐tundra ecotone of the Northwest Territories and compared these with observations of seed and seedling density. We also investigated relationships between seedling abundance, topographic position, and ground cover. Observed patterns of recruitment were complex, with preferential expansion occurring beneath alder patches only on the steepest slopes. Seed accumulation models representing overland flow, wind, and source distance were important predictors of seedling recruitment. This provides indirect evidence of localized seed limitation around patches, suggesting future recruitment may not respond as expected to changing environmental conditions. Sphagnum cover also predicted recruitment, indicating the importance of seedbed conditions for establishment. We propose that developing models of shrub expansion that include both dispersal and environmental constraints may increase our ability to predict patterns and rates of expansion. Such predictions are necessary to understand future biosphere‐atmosphere interactions in a rapidly changing Arctic.},

Where present, permafrost exerts a primary control on water fluxes, flowpaths, and distribution. Climate warming and related drivers of soil thermal change are expected to modify the distribution of permafrost, leading to changing hydrologic conditions, including alterations in soil moisture, connectivity of inland waters, streamflow seasonality, and the partitioning of water stored above and below ground. The field of permafrost hydrology is undergoing rapid advancement with respect to multiscale observations, subsurface characterization, modeling, and integration with other disciplines. However, gaining predictive capability of the many interrelated consequences of climate change is a persistent challenge due to several factors. Observations of hydrologic change have been causally linked to permafrost thaw, but applications of process‐based models needed to support and enhance the transferability of empirical linkages have often been restricted to generalized representations. Limitations stem from inadequate baseline permafrost and unfrozen hydrogeologic characterization, lack of historical data, and simplifications in structure and process representation needed to counter the high computational demands of cryohydrogeologic simulations. Further, due in part to the large degree of subsurface heterogeneity of permafrost landscapes and the nonuniformity in thaw patterns and rates, associations between various modes of permafrost thaw and hydrologic change are not readily scalable; even trajectories of change can differ. This review highlights promising advances in characterization and modeling of permafrost regions and presents ongoing research challenges toward projecting hydrologic and ecologic consequences of permafrost thaw at time and spatial scales that are useful to managers and researchers.},

  abstract = {The overall spatial and temporal influence of shrub expansion on permafrost is largely unknown due to uncertainty in estimating the magnitude of many counteracting processes. For example, shrubs shade the ground during the snow-free season, which can reduce active layer thickness. At the same time, shrubs advance the timing of snowmelt when they protrude through the snow surface, thereby exposing the active layer to thawing earlier in spring. Here, we compare 3056 in situ frost table depth measurements split between mineral earth hummocks and organic inter-hummock zones across four dominant shrub–tundra vegetation types. Snow-free date, snow depth, hummock development, topography, and vegetation cover were compared to frost table depth measurements using a structural equation modeling approach that quantifies the direct and combined interacting influence of these variables. Areas of birch shrubs became snow free earlier regardless of snow depth or hillslope aspect because they protruded through the snow surface, leading to deeper hummock frost table depths. Projected increases in shrub height and extent combined with projected decreases in snowfall would lead to increased shrub protrusion across the Arctic, potentially deepening the active layer in areas where shrub protrusion advances the snow-free date.},

  abstract = {Very high spatial resolution commercial satellite imagery can inform observation, mapping, and documentation of micro-topographic transitions across large tundra regions. The bridging of fine-scale field studies with pan-Arctic system assessments has until now been constrained by a lack of overlap in spatial resolution and geographical coverage. This likely introduced biases in climate impacts on, and feedback from the Arctic region to the global climate system. The central objective of this exploratory study is to develop an object-based image analysis workflow to automatically extract ice-wedge polygon troughs from very high spatial resolution commercial satellite imagery. We employed a systematic experiment to understand the degree of interoperability of knowledge-based workflows across distinct tundra vegetation units—sedge tundra and tussock tundra—focusing on the same semantic class. In our multi-scale trough modelling workflow, we coupled mathematical morphological filtering with a segmentation process to enhance the quality of image object candidates and classification accuracies. Employment of the master ruleset on sedge tundra reported classification accuracies of correctness of 0.99, completeness of 0.87, and F1 score of 0.92. When the master ruleset was applied to tussock tundra without any adaptations, classification accuracies remained promising while reporting correctness of 0.87, completeness of 0.77, and an F1 score of 0.81. Overall, results suggest that the object-based image analysis-based trough modelling workflow exhibits substantial interoperability across the terrain while producing promising classification accuracies. From an Arctic earth science perspective, the mapped troughs combined with the ArcticDEM can allow hydrological assessments of lateral connectivity of the rapidly changing Arctic tundra landscape, and repeated mapping can allow us to track fine-scale changes across large regions and that has potentially major implications on larger riverine systems.},
